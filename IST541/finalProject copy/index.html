 		<h1>Industrial Sprayer Job Aid</h1>
		<h2>By Oscar Mendez</h2>
		<p>When it comes to a close-contact sport such as wrestling, disinfecting the wrestling mat is an essential requirement in preventing skin lesions. Whether it is the beginning of a wrestling tournament or a daily-scheduled practice, sanitizing the wrestling mat is the first step in participating in the sport safely. This aid can provide guidance for volunteers and wrestlers who are unfamiliar with the sanitation process as well as a refresher.</p>
		<b></b>
		<p>In past times, the most common practice to sanitize a mat was using heavy duty mop bucket and a mop with the approriate cleaning solution. Although this can disinfect the mats effectively, it is a tedious process that prolongs the commencement of competition and practice. The Industrial Sprayer allow for this process to be done in an efficient manner while keeping your wrestlers from possible skin lesions. Click on the links below to explore some of the web pages elaborating more on the industrial sprayer. </p>
